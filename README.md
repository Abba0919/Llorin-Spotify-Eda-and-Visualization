# Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify 2023 Dataset

## Guideline
in this deliverable, you will make an exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information about popular tracks on Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023. This task aims to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data to extract meaningful insights.

## Introduction
In this project, we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing Spotify's most streamed songs of 2023, available on Kaggle. This dataset includes critical features such as track popularity, streaming counts, music attributes like tempo and energy, and the release dates of the songs. Through Data analysis, we can explore what really drives a song to the top of the chart and revealing what the listeners wants to hear. 

## Importing Python Libarary 
before anything else, you need to import python tools such as pandas, matplot and seaborn

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```



## Overview of Dataset
- After importing the python library, you need to load the data using the `pd.read_csv()`.
```python
df = pd.read_csv('spotify-2023.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1')
df
```
 - I used ISO-8859-1 to ensure that the characters in the csv file are properly interpreted and file of the spotify-2023 contains special characters like accented letters.

  - I used this code to know what I will input in the markdown for output.

```python
print(df.head().to_markdown())
```
    
- How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?
  - The dataset contains 953 rows Ã— 24 columns
    
- What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?
  - To know the data types of each column we need to input:
```python
df.info()
```

  - Output:
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 953 entries, 0 to 952
Data columns (total 24 columns):

| # | Column | Non-Null Count | Dtype |

 - By using `df.info()` , you can know if there are any missing values. The key and in_shazam_charts has 858 and 903 non-null count while all of the column contains 953 non-null count. This means that these two contains misisng values. Also, by using this panda function, you can see the data type of the 24 columns that has been displayed.

## Basic Descriptive Statistics
- What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?
  
- What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?

## Top Performers
- Which track has the highest number of streams? Display the top 5 most streamed tracks.
```python
df.nlargest(5, 'streams')[['track_name', 'streams']]
```

- Output:
    
  - This outputs the top 5 most streamed tracks, and the top 1 track is the Blinding Lights.

| | track_name | streams |
|--|-----------|---------|
| 55 | Blinding Lights |	3.703895e+09 |
| 179 | Shape of You |	3.562544e+09 |
| 86 | Someone You Loved | 2.887242e+09 |
| 620 | Dance Monkey |	2.864792e+09 |
| 41 | Sunflower - Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse |	2.808097e+09 |


- Who are the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset?
   - To know the top 5 mos frequent artist, you need to input:
```python
df['artist(s)_name'].value_counts().head(5).nlargest(5)
```
 - Output:
   
| artist(s)_name | |
|----------------|-|
| Taylor Swift | 34 |
| The Weeknd | 22 |
| Bad Bunny | 19 |
| SZA | 19 |
| Harry Styles | 17 |

Name: count, dtype: int64

  - This displaces the top 5 most frequent artists and the most frequent artist based on the number of tracks in Taylor Swift.
    
## Temporal Trends
- Analyze the trends in the number of tracks released over time. Plot the number of tracks released per year.
  - To know the number of track released over time, I used the code:
  - Input:
```python
year_distribution = df.groupby('released_year').size().sort_index()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.bar(year_distribution.index, year_distribution.values, color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Year of Release')
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks')
plt.title('Number of Tracks Released Per Year')
plt.show()
```
  - Output:
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27338400-837d-4250-90a0-41f366d1f618)

  - By using this code, you will know that the bar graph is increasing every year and the highest track released over time is on year 2022.

- Does the number of tracks released per month follow any noticeable patterns? Which month sees the most releases?
  - To know the number of tracks released per month, I use the code:
  - Input:
```python
year_distribution = df.groupby('released_year').size().sort_index()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.bar(year_distribution.index, year_distribution.values, color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Year of Release')
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks')
plt.title('Tracks Released Per Year')
plt.show()
```
   - Output:
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40f2f931-6870-4439-b3e0-75de93a5a338)

   
   - By using this code, the most release track will be on January and May labelling 1 and 5.
     
## Genre and Music Characteristics
- Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?
  - By using the code below, you may the correlations between these and which attributes seem to influence the stream.
  - Input:
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 5))
attr = ['streams', 'bpm', 'danceability_%', 'energy_%']
dfs = df[attr]


# Scatter plot for Streams and BPM
plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
plt.scatter(dfs['bpm'], dfs['streams'], color='violet')
plt.xlabel('BPM')
plt.ylabel('Streams')
plt.title('Streams and BPM')

# Scatter plot for Streams and Danceability
plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
plt.scatter(dfs['danceability_%'], dfs['streams'], color='orange')
plt.xlabel('Danceability (%)')
plt.ylabel('Streams')
plt.title('Streams and Danceability')

# Scatter plot for Streams vs. Energy
plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
plt.scatter(dfs['energy_%'], dfs['streams'], color='black')
plt.xlabel('Energy (%)')
plt.ylabel('Streams')
plt.title('Streams vs. Energy')

plt.show()
```
   - Output:
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68181e6b-4ce1-4a82-9cb8-aceec9ea7ba0)

   - If you look at the scatter plot above, the most influence stream the most are danceability and energy because these two shows the most correlation between the three.
     
- Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?
- In danceability and energy:
- Input:
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 5))
attr = ['danceability_%', 'energy_%']
dfs = df[attr]

plt.scatter(dfs['danceability_%'], dfs['energy_%'], color='red')
plt.xlabel('Danceability (%)')
plt.ylabel('Energy')
plt.title('Enrgy and Danceability')

plt.show()
```
  - Output:
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc95151-7f96-4962-851f-9ff3617f483e)

  - As shown from above, Danceability and Bpm shows the most

  - In valence and acousticness:
  - Input:
    
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 5))
attr = ['valence_%', 'acousticness_%']
dfs = df[attr]

plt.scatter(dfs['valence_%'], dfs['acousticness_%'], color='red')
plt.xlabel('valence_ (%)')
plt.ylabel('acousticness_')
plt.title('valence_ and acousticness_')

plt.show()
```
 - Output:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94505ff8-6ab0-4558-95e7-55c11f3d1d08)

 - The picture shown above shows no correlation between valence and acousticess.
   
## Platform Popularity
 - How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, spotify_charts, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?
 
## Advanced Analysis
- Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?
 

- Do certain genres or artists consistently appear in more playlists or charts? Perform an analysis to compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts.
  - Input:
```python
# Group the data
artcts = df.groupby('artist(s)_name')[['in_spotify_playlists', 'in_spotify_charts', 'in_apple_playlists']].sum()

# Calculate the total appearances across all categories for each artist
artcts['total_appearances'] = artcts.sum(axis=1)

# Sort the artists based on their total appearances and select the top 10
top_10_artists = artcts.sort_values(by='total_appearances', ascending=False).head(10)

# Reset index to make the artist names a column
top_10_artists.reset_index(inplace=True)

top_10_artists
```
  - Output:
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8262279e-7d01-447b-9739-953ad2d7daf4)
  - This shows the top 10 genres or artist tat appear more. That being said, The Weekend appear to be top 1 who appear the most.
